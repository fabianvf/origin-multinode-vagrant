# origin-multinode-vagrant

This repository stands up a 4 node origin cluster with Centos as the base images. It uses vagrant snapshots to quickly bring up an origin cluster ready to be used.

The origin cluster by default has a user 'admin' with password 'admin' which has full cluster privileges.

# To run:
```
./up.sh
```

# Cluster information:
```
hostname: master.example.com
IP: 192.168.156.5
User: admin
pass: admin
```
# Deploying an Ansible Service Broker inside the cluster
Note: This requires docker installed on the host that this script is run.
```
./deploy_broker.sh <dockerhub_user> <dockerhub_password>
```

# Common issues:
If iptables is running or some firewall, the default IP address used in the `deploy_broker.sh` script may not be accessible from within the docker network on your host. To fix this you can run the following command on your host:
``` 
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -d 192.168.156.0/24 -j ACCEPT
```
